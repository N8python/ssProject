<h1><strong>The Growth of Plantations and the Transatlantic Slave Trade</strong></h1>
<p style="line-height: 2;">Sugar was the one of the most valuable crops in the Americas ever since they were first discovered by Europeans. It originally was cultivated in New Guinea but spread to many different places. Sugar was a very important part involving trade, so people
    made a lot of profit from trading it. It was introduced to Europe through the Middle East, and then grown on the islands of the Mediterranean and Atlantic. Columbus introduced sugar to the Americas, and then it was left to the Portugese in America.
    This all made sugar cultivation profitable. However, the more sugar cane being traded meant more and more enslavement from the 16th century lasting until the 19th century, when it was abolished. To make sugar cultivation faster, millions of slaves
    were ripped from their homes and shipped to plantations in the New World and the West Indies to work on sugar plantations. Slaves from Africa were shipped to the Americas, and the Americans traded raw products to England like sugar, tobacco, rice
    and cotton. The Brazilians, who dominated sugar cultivation by the late 16th century, instituted a racial system that was more lenient than the American racial system. Free people of color were allowed to advance under some circumstances and were
    allowed to have a lot more rights. However, the slave trade was still brutal and some slaves had to do it for life with only the motivation to not get punished. As slavery expanded, so did the development of more efficient sugar processing technology,
    like steam-powered mills.</p>
